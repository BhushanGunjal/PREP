# Technical Interview Questions for SAP PI Developer (3 Years of Experience)

This document provides a detailed list of technical questions and crisp, concise answers to help prepare for an SAP PI job interview. The questions are tailored for a candidate with approximately three years of hands-on experience, covering core concepts, practical scenarios, and an awareness of modern trends.

## 1. Fundamentals: Core Concepts of SAP PI Architecture and Components

### **Q1. Can you briefly explain the SAP PI architecture and its main components?**
**A:** SAP PI's core components are the **Integration Server** (central processing engine), **Enterprise Services Repository (ESR)** for design objects, and the **Integration Directory (ID)** for configuration. The **System Landscape Directory (SLD)** manages system information, and the **Runtime Workbench** is used for monitoring.

### **Q2. What’s the role of the Integration Server in SAP PI?**
**A:** The Integration Server is the heart of PI. It processes messages at runtime, handling crucial tasks like message routing, mapping, and communicating with various adapters.

### **Q3. How is synchronous communication handled in SAP PI?**
**A:** For synchronous communication, PI handles the request and response in a single, continuous transaction. Common adapters for this are the **SOAP** and **RFC** adapters, which are used for real-time data exchange where an immediate response is required.

## 2. Technical Scenarios & Adapters

### **Q4. What adapters have you worked with, and in which scenarios?**
**A:** I have hands-on experience with **File, IDoc, SOAP, REST, JDBC, and SFTP** adapters. I've used the File adapter for batch processing, SOAP for integrating with external web services, and JDBC for connecting to non-SAP databases.

### **Q5. How do you configure an IDoc to File scenario?**
**A:** The process involves creating the IDoc interface and message mapping in the **ESR**. In the **Integration Directory**, I configure the sender agreement (IDoc), the receiver agreement (File), and the communication channel. On the SAP backend, I set up the necessary partner profiles and ports.

### **Q6. What’s the difference between the SOAP and REST adapters in PI?**
**A:** The **SOAP** adapter is based on WSDLs and uses an XML-based payload, making it suitable for structured, service-oriented communication. The **REST** adapter is more lightweight, uses HTTP methods, and is ideal for modern, JSON-based web services.

## 3. Mapping and Transformation

### **Q7. What types of mappings have you implemented in SAP PI?**
**A:** I primarily use **Graphical Mapping** for its simplicity and wide range of standard functions. I also have experience with **XSLT mapping** and writing custom logic using **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**.

### **Q8. How do you handle value mapping between different systems?**
**A:** I use **Value Mapping tables** to handle data inconsistencies between systems, for example, mapping a legacy system's country code to SAP's standard code. This can be configured in the ESR or in the SLD.

### **Q9. Can you explain a case where you used UDF in a mapping?**
**A:** I once used a UDF to convert a date string from "MM/dd/yyyy" to "yyyyMMdd" to match a file naming convention required by the receiver system. UDFs are great for implementing custom logic not available in standard functions.

## 4. Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### **Q10. How do you monitor PI messages?**
**A:** I mainly use the **Message Monitor** in the Runtime Workbench to check message status and logs. For more specific issues, I use transaction codes like **SXMB_MONI** (for ABAP stack) and **SM58** for tRFC errors.

### **Q11. What steps do you take when a message fails in PI?**
**A:** I first identify the error in the **Message Monitor**. I then analyze the error log, check the message payload, and inspect the specific adapter's communication channel log to pinpoint the root cause. This could be anything from a mapping error to an invalid certificate.

### **Q12. How do you restart a failed asynchronous message?**
**A:** In the **Message Monitor**, I manually restart the failed message. This is possible only after the underlying issue has been resolved.

## 5. Advanced Topics & Trends

### **Q13. What’s the difference between SAP PI and SAP PO?**
**A:** **SAP PO** is an evolution of PI. It's a single-stack system that includes PI's functionality plus **Business Process Management (BPM)** and **Business Rules Management (BRM)**. This consolidation allows for better performance and a reduced total cost of ownership.

### **Q14. Have you worked on SAP CPI (Integration Suite)? How is it different?**
**A:** Yes, I have experience with **SAP Cloud Platform Integration (CPI)**. Unlike PI/PO, CPI is a cloud-based integration platform, which makes it ideal for hybrid scenarios. It's lighter, uses **iFlows** instead of integration scenarios, and is well-suited for modern API-driven integrations, especially with SAP's SaaS offerings.

### **Q15. What do you see as the future of SAP PI/PO?**
**A:** While PI/PO is still a strong solution for on-premise integrations, the long-term strategic direction from SAP is towards **SAP Integration Suite (CPI)**. Therefore, upskilling in CPI is becoming increasingly important for integrating with cloud-based systems and leveraging new technologies.
